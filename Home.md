## First Steps
**If you're entirely new to reinforcement learning**, the best thing to do is to poke through the resources listed in [Written Introductions](#written-introductions) and [Video Introductions](#video-introductions) and see which ones suit your learning style.

All of these cover roughly the same material, and all have roughly the same prerequisites: 
 * you should be comfortable with probability, statistics, linear algebra and multivariable calculus at a first-year-undergrad level, 
 * you should be comfortable with programming in Python,
 * and you should be familiar with deep learning concepts like convolutions and gradient descent.

**If you're entirely new to probability/statistics/linear algebra/multivariable calculus**, we'll make a weak recommendation for Khan Academy's [stats](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)/[lin alg](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)/[calc](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) courses, or for the [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) book. These resources suit a lot of people well.

**If you're entirely new to programming in Python**, [the /r/python wiki has a range of introductory resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/wiki/index#wiki_online_books_and_resources) and we'll make a weak recommendation for [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) as a book that suits many people well. 

**If you're entirely new to deep learning**, [the /r/ML wiki has a range of introductory resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/wiki/index), and we'll make a weak recommendation for [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) as a course that suits many people well. 

## Debugging Advice
* [Andy Jones's advice](https://andyljones.com/posts/rl-debugging.html)
* [Matthew Rahtz's advice](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl)
* [John Schulman's advice](https://github.com/williamFalcon/DeepRLHacks)
* [Joshua Achiam's advice](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html#learn-by-doing)
* [Marcin Gumer's advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/9sh77q/what_are_your_best_tips_for_debugging_rl_problems/e8p2as5/)
* [Antonin Raffin's advice](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/rl_tips.html)
* [Clemens Winter's advice](https://clemenswinter.com/2021/03/24/my-reinforcement-learning-learnings/)

If you go through these and you're still stuck, come ask for help in #practical on the Discord. Keep in mind that debugging RL is extraordinarily tricky even when you've direct access, so don't expect miracles! It helps a lot if you can share a minimal example, describe the problem in detail, and explain how you've tried to fix it so far. The more detail you put into your question, the more likely it'll be a good answer! 

## Things We Recommend
These resources are things we have first-hand experience of and can testify to the quality of.

If you've had a good experience with a resource, edit this page and increment the üëç. Feel free to move stuff from the things-we-found section up to here if you've personally had a good experience with it. If you're uncertain, come discuss it in #wiki first.

### Written Introductions
 * 4üëç [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/) is somewhere between an extended tutorial and a short course, with a practical bent. 
 * 7üëç [Sutton & Barto's *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning*](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf) is the standard intro textbook.
 * 1üëç [Deep Reinforcement Learning Series](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-deep-reinforcement-learning-series-833319a95530) by [Jonathan Hui](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui)
 * 1üëç [Algorithms for Decision Making](http://algorithmsbook.com/) by Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Tim A. Wheeler, and Kyle H. Wray. Great introduction for RL. Lots of great resources on various subjects. 

### Video Introductions
 * 7üëç [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB), with [slides](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)
 * 2üëç [Deep RL Course by Thomas Simonnini](https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/)
 * 2üëç [Reinforcement Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) from Martha and David White, professors at UAlberta
   * Unlike all the other materials listed here, this is not free. Our opinions on paywalled courses are divided, so take this as a qualified recommendation - only go down this route if you have a strong preference for MOOC-style learning. If you don't, any of the other free material is just as good.

### Miscellaneous
 * 3üëç [Lilian Weng's Blog on RL](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/tag/reinforcement-learning), a *phenomenal* set of survey posts on different areas of RL.
 * 3üëç [TalkRL Podcast](https://www.talkrl.com/) is all about Reinforcement Learning

### Frameworks and Libraries
 * 2üëç [Stable Baselines in Pytorch (SB3)](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/), a set of robust, reliable implementations of RL algorithms.
 * 1üëç [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master/cleanrl), a set of single-file implementations of basic RL algorithms.
 * 1üëç [RLlib by Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html), one of the better attempts at plug-n-play distributed RL.
 * 1üëç [AI Traineree](https://github.com/laszukdawid/ai-traineree), simple implementations with agents/envs being independent.
