This is the wiki for the [reinforcement learning Discord](https://discord.gg/xhfNqQv), as described [in the launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/jawm37/official_reinforcement_learning_discord/). 

This is editable by anyone. If it grows into its own thing, I'll move it off my personal account and onto an organisation account.

## Educational Resources

### Introductions to RL
 * [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/) is somewhere between an extended tutorial and a short course, with a practical bent. 
 * Sutton & Barto's *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning* is the standard intro textbook.

### Lecture Videos
 * [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB), with [slides](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)

## Community projects

### General RL Library Implementations
_This sections hosts libraries or common implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms eg (DQN & variants, PPO, A2C etc) made by members of the community. It is generally agreed within the community that when learning it is always helpful to have reference code to give ideas or examples - the purpose of this section is to provide those, but written by members of the community so that the author is available to answer questions._

## Misc

### Other Discords
 * [RL Group](https://discord.gg/2hz4kzK): previously the most active server, though abandoned by the admin
 * [Artificial Intelligence](https://discord.gg/gFCT9jm): extremely large, has an RL channel
 * [International Reinforcement Learning Group](https://discord.gg/2Z98qcQ): a bit less active than RL Group, though apparently has a more active private channel.
 * [ODS.ai](https://ods.ai/): their Slack has an active Russian-language community.
