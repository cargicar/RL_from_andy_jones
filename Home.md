This is the wiki for the [reinforcement learning Discord](https://discord.gg/xhfNqQv), as described [in the launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/jawm37/official_reinforcement_learning_discord/). 

This is editable by anyone. If it grows into its own thing, I'll move it off my personal account and onto an organisation account.

If you've had a particularly good experience with a resource, edit this page and increment the üëç.

### General Resources

### Homegrown Resources
These resources have been *written* by people on our Discord. The advantage of these resources is that you can ask the author questions about them! 

* [RL Lib](https://github.com/DarylRodrigo/rl_lib), by @-D-
* [BootlegAlphaZero](https://github.com/instance01/BootlegAlphaZero/), by @aylmao

### Other Communities
 * [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/): the main hub for the RL community
 * [RL Group](https://discord.gg/2hz4kzK): previously the most active server, though abandoned by the admin
 * [Artificial Intelligence](https://discord.gg/gFCT9jm): extremely large, has an RL channel
 * [International Reinforcement Learning Group](https://discord.gg/2Z98qcQ): a bit less active than RL Group, though apparently has a more active private channel.
 * [ODS.ai](https://ods.ai/): their Slack has an active Russian-language community.

### Future considerations
 * Split resources into academic and applied
