This is the wiki for the [reinforcement learning Discord](https://discord.gg/xhfNqQv), as described [in the launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/jawm37/official_reinforcement_learning_discord/). 

This is editable by anyone. If it grows into its own thing, I'll move it off my personal account and onto an organisation account.

### Community Resources
* [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/)

### Introductions to RL
 * [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/) is somewhere between an extended tutorial and a short course, with a practical bent. 
 * Sutton & Barto's *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning* is the standard intro textbook.

### Other Discords
 * [RL Group](https://discord.gg/2hz4kzK): previously the most active server, though abandoned by the admin
 * [Artificial Intelligence](https://discord.gg/gFCT9jm): extremely large, has an RL channel
 * [International Reinforcement Learning Group](https://discord.gg/2Z98qcQ): a bit less active than RL Group, though apparently has a more active private channel.
 * [ODS.ai](https://ods.ai/): their Slack has an active Russian-language community.
