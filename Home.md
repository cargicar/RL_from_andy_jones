This is the wiki for the [reinforcement learning Discord](https://discord.gg/xhfNqQv), as described [in the launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/jawm37/official_reinforcement_learning_discord/). 

This is editable by anyone. If it grows into its own thing, I'll move it off my personal account and onto an organisation account.

## Things We Recommend
These resources are things we have first-hand experience of and can testify to the quality of.

If you've had a good experience with a resource, edit this page and increment the 👍. Feel free to move stuff from the things-we-found section up to here if you've personally had a good experience with it. If you're uncertain, come discuss it in #wiki first.

### Written Introductions
 * 1👍 [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/) is somewhere between an extended tutorial and a short course, with a practical bent. 
 * 1👍 [Sutton & Barto's *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning*](https://bit.ly/3oiyUEw) is the standard intro textbook.

### Lecture Videos
 * 1👍 [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB), with [slides](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)
 * 1👍 [Deep RL Course by Thomas Simonnini](https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/)

### Miscellaneous
 * 1👍 [Lilian Weng's Blog on RL](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/tag/reinforcement-learning), a *phenomenal* set of survey posts on different areas of RL.
 * 1👍 [RL Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/), the main hub for the RL community
 * [TalkRL Podcast](https://www.talkrl.com/) is all Reinforcement Learning

## Things We Made
These resources have been *written* by people on our Discord. The advantage of these resources is that you can ask the author questions about them!

## Things We Found
This is a broad-strokes collection of things we've found in our journey through RL that we think might be useful to others. It is much more lightly curated than the other sections.
