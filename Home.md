This is the wiki for the [reinforcement learning Discord](https://discord.gg/xhfNqQv), as described [in the launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/jawm37/official_reinforcement_learning_discord/). 

This is editable by anyone. If it grows into its own thing, I'll move it off my personal account and onto an organisation account.

## Educational Resources

### Introductions to RL
 * [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/) is somewhere between an extended tutorial and a short course, with a practical bent. 
 * Sutton & Barto's *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning* is the standard intro textbook.
 * [Denny Britz's RL implementations](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning) of basic foundational RL algorithms.

### Lecture Videos
 * [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBiG_XpjnPrSNw-1XQaM_gB), with [slides](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)
 * [Reinforcement Learning Course | DeepMind & UCL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZBKeNJ-JE_eyJHZ7XgBoAyb)
 * [CS285@berkeley - Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)
 * [CS234@stanford - Reinforcement Learning Winter 2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u)
 * [Deep RL Bootcamp 2017](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures)
 * [Deep RL Course by Thomas Simonnini](https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/)
    * I've heard good things about it on reddit.

### Homegrown Resources
The libraries and implementations below are written by people from our Discord. The advantage of these resources is that you can ask the author questions about them! 

* [RL Lib](https://github.com/DarylRodrigo/rl_lib)
* [BootlegAlphaZero](https://github.com/instance01/BootlegAlphaZero/)

### Other Communities
 * [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/): the main hub for the RL community
 * [RL Group](https://discord.gg/2hz4kzK): previously the most active server, though abandoned by the admin
 * [Artificial Intelligence](https://discord.gg/gFCT9jm): extremely large, has an RL channel
 * [International Reinforcement Learning Group](https://discord.gg/2Z98qcQ): a bit less active than RL Group, though apparently has a more active private channel.
 * [ODS.ai](https://ods.ai/): their Slack has an active Russian-language community.
