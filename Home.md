This is the wiki for the [reinforcement learning Discord](https://discord.gg/xhfNqQv), as described [in the launch post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/jawm37/official_reinforcement_learning_discord/). 

This is editable by anyone. If it grows into its own thing, I'll move it off my personal account and onto an organisation account.

## First Steps
**If you're entirely new to reinforcement learning**, the best thing to do is to poke through the resources listed in [Written Introductions](#written-introductions) and [Video Introductions](#video-introductions) and see which ones suit your learning style.

All of these cover roughly the same material, and all have roughly the same prerequisites: you should be comfortable with probability, statistics, linear algebra and multivariable calculus at a first-year-undergrad level, and you should be comfortable with programming in Python. It's also useful to have some basic familiarity with deep learning.

**If you're entirely new to probability/statistics/linear algebra/multivariable calculus**, we'll make a weak recommendation for Khan Academy's [stats](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)/[lin alg](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)/[calc](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) courses, or for the [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) book. These resources suit a lot of people well.

**If you're entirely new to programming in Python**, [the /r/python wiki has a range of introductory resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/wiki/index#wiki_online_books_and_resources) and we'll make a weak recommendation for [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) as a book that suits many people well. 

**If you're entirely new to deep learning**, [the /r/ML wiki has a range of introductory resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/wiki/index), and we'll make a weak recommendation for [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) as a course that suits many people well. 


## Things We Recommend
These resources are things we have first-hand experience of and can testify to the quality of.

If you've had a good experience with a resource, edit this page and increment the üëç. Feel free to move stuff from the things-we-found section up to here if you've personally had a good experience with it. If you're uncertain, come discuss it in #wiki first.

## Things We Found
This is a broad-strokes collection of things we've found in our journey through RL that we think might be useful to others. It is much more lightly curated than the other sections.

## TODO
 * Split resources into academic and applied if it gets too big
 * Still need a 'maths hub' to point to, as well as specific recommendations
