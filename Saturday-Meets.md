We have a voice chat every Saturday at 1630 GMT. 

### Notes for attendees
 * Please switch yourself to push-to-talk, or mute yourself when you're not speaking.
 * Everyone's welcome to speak during the session, except when the presenter's speaking. 
 * There'll be time at the start to introduce yourself if you'd like. A good intro is where you are in the world and what you're working on. 
 * The presentation usually lasts 10-30 mins, and might involve screen sharing or content copy-pasted into the text channel. 
 * We usually type out commentary and questions in the text channel while the presenter's talking.
 * There'll be questions at the end, followed by freeform discussion.
 * If you'd like to present in future, just say!

### Notes for (potential) presenters
If you're uneasy about giving talks, this is a great place to practice. Normal attendance is 10-20 people, questions are much more inquisitive than critical, it's voice only, and we've had a wide range of speakers in terms of technical experience. If you're casting around for a topic, a good choice is something you've been working on recently.

### Presenter Schedule
I'll try and keep this rolling one month in advance. If you see a slot free, you're welcome to volunteer yourself - just edit in your Discord handle and a rough topic.
