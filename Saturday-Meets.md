**These are suspended till we can find someone else to run them**

We have a voice chat every Saturday. Current time is 18:00 GMT / 13:00 EST / 10:00 PST. 

## Notes for attendees
 * Please switch yourself to push-to-talk, or mute yourself when you're not speaking.
 * Everyone's welcome to speak during the session, except when the presenter's speaking. 
 * There'll be time at the start to introduce yourself if you'd like. A good intro is where you are in the world and what you're working on. 
 * The presentation usually lasts 10-30 mins, and might involve screen sharing or content copy-pasted into the text channel. 
 * We usually type out commentary and questions in the text channel while the presenter's talking.
 * There'll be questions at the end, followed by freeform discussion.
 * If you'd like to present in future, just say!

### Notes for (potential) presenters
If you're uneasy about giving talks, this is a great place to practice. Normal attendance is 10-20 people, questions are much more inquisitive than critical, it's voice only, and we've had a wide range of speakers in terms of technical experience. If you're casting around for a topic, a good choice is something you've been working on recently.
