We have a voice chat every Saturday. Current time is 18:00 GMT / 13:00 EST / 10:00 PST.

Scheduled presentations are listed below.

### Format
Presentations usually last 10 -- 30 minutes followed by questions and discussion. Usually we're done in less than an hour, but people will often stay and discuss more.

Typical format is a Discord screen share by the presenter. It isn't necessary a "presentation" with slides; there are demos with commentary, paper reviews with notes or simple discussions with pasted links.

**Note**: Bare in mind that we are strangers on the internet who try to learn something from each other and have a general good time.

### Notes for attendees

 * Please switch yourself to **push-to-talk, or mute** yourself when you're not speaking.
 * Everyone's welcome to speak during the session, except when the presenter's speaking. 
 * Feel free to introduce yourself at the start. A good intro is where you are in the world and what you're working on. 
 * We usually type out **commentary and questions** in the text channel while the presenter's talking.
 * There'll be questions at the end, followed by freeform discussion.
 * If you'd like to present in future, just say!

### Notes for presenters

* Please let us know whether we can interrupt with questions at any point, or should we wait until asked.
* If you're answering a question from the channel, please say the question out loud so that everyone knows what you are referring to.

### Should I present?

If you're uneasy about giving talks, this is a great place to practice. Normal attendance is 10-40 people, questions are much more inquisitive than critical, it's voice only, and we've had a wide range of speakers in terms of technical experience. If you're casting around for a topic, a good choice is something you've been working on recently.

## Presentations

Would you like to present? Great! Feel free to add yourself to the table below, if the spot is available. Also, to minimize confusion, mention it in the channel so that others know :)
