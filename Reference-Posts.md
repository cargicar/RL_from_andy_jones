i'd really like to see an in-depth article on debugging RL, although i understand how difficult it would be to give general advice to what are usually very specific problems. i've found the following pretty helpful though:

### [On norms on the server](https://discord.com/channels/765294874832273419/765878442242736159/768505988306960384), @andyljones

Okay, so I have my philosophical opinion on this, my realised opinion, and then what I aim to point this server at.

My philosophical opinion is that freedom of speech is a messy topic. There are kinds of speech that everyone agrees should be proscribed (shouting 'fire' in a crowded theatre) and kinds of speech that everyone agrees should be free (chatting with your brother about the weather). That is to say: there are cases where everyone agrees that the benefits to free expression outweigh the costs, and there are cases where everyone agrees that they don't.

So then the argument is not over whether speech should be free or not, but which speech should be free. Which speech benefits society more when said than unsaid? And more self-referentially, which speech is worth protecting for the sake of protecting speech as a whole?

And these are... messy value judgements, and I understand how different people come to different conclusions.

All that said, my realised opinion is the vast majority of the shift in the boundaries of free speech over the past few decades has been for the benefit of society. Some people have lost the ability to express some opinions, but I think that loss has been worth it for what has been gained. Principally - selfishly - I have a foundational belief that talent can arise from anywhere, and I am very much invested in removing the barriers to that talent making fat stacks so I can live in a richer, smarter society.

But this server isn't for me! It's for the community. So I'm regressing my weird views to the mean and adopting what our (my) society seems to have decided are the Rules of Engagement for intelligent adults working productively together, and those are the norms of corporate workplaces and university classrooms.
