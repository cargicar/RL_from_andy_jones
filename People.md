* **andyljones**: I'm an independent researcher, living in London and working on [an RL-based scaling laws project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OwniAl1ocnqKHc4jtPVJzemm46q6ZgPVhXhmL2ZDIJw/edit?usp=sharing). Tag me if you'd like to talk about AI alignment, indie research, or about any of my previous projects! [Here's my website](https://andyljones.com/).

* **aylmao | Daniel**: I'm a CS masters student based in Germany. My interests include anything related to [AlphaZero](https://github.com/instance01/GRAB0/) and MCTS based approaches, [emergent behaviour](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isal_a_00226) in intelligent agents and MARL. Contact: [Github](https://github.com/instance01), [Blog](https://blog.xa0.de/list).

* **Ariel**: I'm a PhD student currently in France working on crowd simulation via MARL. In my free time, I like thinking about [abstract nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense) and [functional programming](https://redtachyon.me/post/aoc-haskell/). Also somewhat interested in AI Safety, emergent behaviors, and essentially anything related to situations with lots of agents. [My website with all other social links](https://redtachyon.me)

* **Samuel Schmidgall**: I'm a student at George Mason University doing research in synaptic plasticity-based meta-learning techniques for reinforcement learning. Most of my work is bio-inspired RL including, spiking neural networks, plasticity, neuromodulation, and evolutionary algorithms. If you're interested in my (limited) work check out my scholar (https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bQDooZEAAAAJ), otherwise feel free to dm me in the discord for collabs, or just to chat!


* **Shay Ronen**: I'm the founder of http://www.deeptrade.ml , we are building the next generation of zero code trading platform integrated with DL/ML. 
we are an innovative team of quants with a goal of making ML/DL accessible to a wider range of users.  Our team also built a connector between the popular trading platform metatrader to python language.  can be found on my github https://github.com/TheSnowGuru/ good luck to all.
